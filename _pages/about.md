Hi, I'm KANG HUI(康辉). I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Advanced Materials, at HKUST. My research interest includes MXene functionalization, photothermal seawater desalination, and electromagnetic shielding.
Currently, I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. GAO Ping(高平)(https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ping-gao) of Polymembranes@NanoResearch Lab from HKUST. I was advised by Prof. LIU Yuyan（刘宇艳）（http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liuyuyan?lang=zh） and Prof. FAN Zhimin(樊志敏)(http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/fanzhimin?lang=zh) from Harbin Institute of Technology during my undergraduate years.
At the same time, I am also passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship and have had several entrepreneurial experiences. At present, I am the founder and CEO of Hong Kong New Era Technology Co., LTD.
In my spare time, I am also keen on photography and marathons.  
You can find my CV here: KANG_max's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum Vitae.pdf)

**Educations**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
